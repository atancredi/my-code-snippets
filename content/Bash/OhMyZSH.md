## Add alias
1. Go to the folder `$ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`    
2. Create a new `.zsh` file. You can name it what ever you’d like, but for testing, I created `aliases.zsh`
3. Add you new aliases to your new file. You can do this by opening the file with your preferred text editor. Here’s what mine looked like
    ```bash
    #An alias to naviage up one directory level
    alias up='cd ..'
    ```
4. Save and quit the editor
5. Restart your terminal _or_ use `source ~/.zshrc`
