it's an incredibly versatile in-memory database that can help solve many different problems.

Now what makes Redis so fast? Unlike disk-based databases, Redis stores all data in memory and uses a single-threaded design. This allows Redis to achieve extremely high throughput and lightning fast speeds for reads and writes. The performance combined with versatile data structures like the ones above enables Redis to power many data-intensive real-time applications.

A typical cache architecture has three layers:

1. Application Cache: This sits inside the application's memory and is usually a hashmap holding frequently accessed data like user profiles. The cache size is small and data is lost when the app restarts.
    
2. Second Level Cache: This is often an in-process or out-of-process cache like EhCache. It requires configuring an eviction policy like LRU, LFU, or TTL based eviction for automatic cache invalidation. The cache is local to each server.
    
3. Distributed Cache: This is usually Redis, deployed on separate servers from the application servers. Redis supports different eviction policies to control what data stays in the cache. The cache can be sharded across multiple servers for horizontal scalability. The cache is shared across multiple apps. Redis offers persistence, replication for high availability, and a rich set of data structures.

Based on the Pareto principle, around 20% of data tends to make up 80% of accesses. So caching the hottest 20% of data in Redis can improve performance for a majority of requests. This 80/20 rule of thumb can guide what data is cached versus stored solely in the database.

The cache hierarchy allows managing different data sizes/access patterns efficiently. The first level cache holds a small volume of very hot data. The second level cache holds more data, still frequently accessed. The distributed Redis cache can hold large datasets by sharding across servers.

Using Redis as a cache improves performance but introduces complexity around cache coherence. There can be multiple copies of data, so read/write strategies need careful design. Typically one data source is designated as the "source of truth" and writes go there first. The application can implement lazy loading and write-through patterns when using Redis as a cache to keep it updated. Cache aside and read aside are other application-level caching patterns that Redis readily supports.

## Session Store

The Session Store is a critical component for web applications to maintain state across requests. Popular solutions like Redis provide a fast, scalable session store by keeping session data in-memory.

The server uses Redis to store session data and associate it with each user. It assigns every client a unique session ID that is sent on each request to retrieve the correct session. Storing sessions in Redis instead of locally on each app server removes the need for "sticky sessions" when load balancing.

Session data in Redis is serialized as JSON or similar format. This enables structured data to be stored like user profiles, recent actions, shopping carts, and CSRF tokens.

Sessions should expire after a period of inactivity. This practice improves security and frees up stale resources. The expiration time can be configured based on app needs.

The diagram below shows a typical Redis session flow:

Steps 1 and 2 - A user login request is sent to the User Service.

Steps 3 and 4 - The User Service creates a new session in Redis by generating a unique session ID.

Steps 5 and 6 - The User Service sends the session ID back to the client where it is stored locally.

Steps 7 and 8 - The user adds a product to their shopping cart. This sends the request to the Shopping Cart Service.

Steps 9 and 10 - The Shopping Cart Service retrieves the session data from Redis using the session ID. It updates the session object in Redis by adding the new shopping cart items.

Steps 11 and 12 - The Shopping Cart Service returns a success status to the client.
