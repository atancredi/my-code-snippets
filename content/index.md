# My Code Snippets

An archive of code snippets, resources and best practices for every Computer Science task I have to deal with daily.

As parts of my job, the topics covers from various low-level applications in _Python_ and other languages to Web Development/Design (mostly JS/TypeScript).

In the future I plan to add all the resources on Data Analysis, Numerical Methods, Algorythms and MLAI gathered during my Bachelor's degree in Physics.
