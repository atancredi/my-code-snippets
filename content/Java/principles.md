To semantically separate functions in Java, you can follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function should have a single responsibility. It should do one thing and do it well. If a function is doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller functions.
    
2. **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names for functions that clearly indicate their purpose. A function name should accurately describe what the function does without the need for additional comments.
    
3. **Encapsulation**: Group related functions together within classes or packages. This helps to organize the codebase and makes it easier to navigate.
    
4. **Use of Helper Functions**: If a function performs a complex task, consider breaking it down into smaller helper functions. This helps to reduce the complexity of each function and makes the code more readable.
    
5. **Comments and Documentation**: Use comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each function, its inputs, outputs, and any side effects. This helps other developers understand how to use the functions correctly.
    

By following these principles and guidelines, you can create Java code that is more readable, maintainable, and robust.
