App Engine is a fully-managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. The user can run an App Engine application in two environments, the standard environment and the flexible environment. While the standard environment is suitable for applications that need to deal with rapid scaling and are intended to run for free or at very low cost, the flexible environment is designed for applications that receive consistent traffic, experience regular traffic fluctuations, or meet the parameters for scaling up and down gradually
