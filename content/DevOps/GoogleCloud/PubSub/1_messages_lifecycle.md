# What is the lifecycle of a message in Pub/Sub?
First, a publisher sends a message to the topic. Once the Pub/Sub server receives the message, it adds fields to the message such as publish timestamp and message ID. Pub/Sub delivers this message to all subscriptions. From each subscription, subscribers pull messages via one of two pull calls (more on this in a bit). Each subscription has an acknowledgement deadline, which determines how much time is allocated for the client to **ack**nowledge (**ack**) this message before the server redelivers it. If the client holds the message beyond the agreed deadline without acking, or if the client sends a **nack** (**n**egative **ack**nowledgement) request, the message will be redelivered (potentially to a different subscriber on the same subscription).
