## advanced button logic
for every state of the button, a different background/outline color pairs must be chosen according to semantics
- disabled state: usually grey-scale, no hover effects

## advanced 'select' logic
- disabled state:  usually grey-scale
- selected but to be updated state: usually blue/neutral (not green, yellow or red). this helps when the select value must be updated with another action (like a button click). a green outline can be applied to the button to indicate that it must be clicked, and after clicking the blue outline of the select becomes white/normal
